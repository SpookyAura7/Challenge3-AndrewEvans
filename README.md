Credits:

Most of what I learned to write the code was from the bootcampspot textbook, although I would like to credit w3schools and mdn web docs for their amazing articles. 

The code snippit I used for the randomization was from the user "Foolish Developer" on the website "dev.to" the link to the page is as follows:

https://dev.to/code_mystery/random-password-generator-using-javascript-6a

I did not copy and paste the code directly, but I used and appended what I needed to in order for it to work with my password generator. I also mentioned the credit as a comment in the javascript file above the aforementioned snippet. 



Features:

You can decide to have a password as short as 8 characters long or as long as 128, or anywhere in between.

You can choose whether or not to incorperate uppercase characters, or just use lowercase. 

You can choose whether or not to incorperate numbers.

You get a confirmation alert to make sure you know what you just chose.
